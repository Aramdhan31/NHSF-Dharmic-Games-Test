# 🏆 Teams Page Fixed - Now Shows Correct Teams!

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**

The teams page was showing static data instead of live Firebase data. Now it properly displays:

- ✅ **Live teams from Firebase** - Real-time data updates
- ✅ **Competing vs Non-competing** - Properly separated and labeled
- ✅ **Sports information** - Shows what sports each university plays
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Changes appear instantly
- ✅ **Proper filtering** - By zone (NZ+CZ, LZ+SZ, All)

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Live Data Integration**
- ✅ Removed static university data
- ✅ Added real-time Firebase listener
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging

### **3. Sports Display**
